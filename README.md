  Challenge 02: Node.js Concepts
</h3>

## :rocket: About the challenge

Create an application to store repositories in my portfolio that should be able to create, read, update, delete them and receive 'likes'.

## :boom: THE tests to be destroyed

- should be able to create a new repository

- should be able to list the repositories

- should be able to update repository

- should not be able to update a repository that does not exist

- should not be able to update repository likes manually

-should be able to delete the repository

- should not be able to delete a repository that does not exist

- should be able to give a like to the repository

- should not be able to like a repository that does not exist

## :nerd_face: What I learned

Leaving aside the requirements for passing automated tests, I learned about:

- Concepts
  - REST APIs
  - JSON
  - HTTP
    - Methods
    - Status Code
  - Middlewares

- Tools
  - Express.js
  - Yarn
  - Nodemon
  - Insomnia
